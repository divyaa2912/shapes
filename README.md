Shapes & Colors ðŸŽ¨
A Java project demonstrating abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces through a simple shape-based system.

Features:
âœ… Abstract Class - Shape: Defines a draw() method.
âœ… Interface - Colorable: Declares a fillColor() method.
âœ… Circle Class: Extends Shape and implements Colorable, providing its own draw() and fillColor() implementations.
âœ… Polymorphism: Calls methods dynamically based on the object type.
